# OOP_Web_TeamProject

This project is developed by Seongho An, Jongwon Shin, Hanmin Lee, Jiwan Kang, and Jaehyeong Ryu from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the Catholic University of Korea.

We follow these requirements:
1. Collect articles from various media outlets. 
2. Indicate the likes or dislikes of media companies and events. 
3. Filter comments. By following these rules, we have a project where articles can be viewed on one website.

We use a flask of python web framework when we implement this project.

And we refered to "Jump to Flask" (https://wikidocs.net/book/4542).
